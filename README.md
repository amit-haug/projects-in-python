Mini projects written in Python language.

Tic Tac Toe.py: A board game played between two players where Player 1 is represented by 'X' and Player 2 is represented by 'O'. Each player take turns to select his/her preferred position on the board. This continues until any player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row and he/she wins the game. The game can also end in no result, when there are no more slots to mark and none of the rows/columns/diagonal matches.

Hangman Game.py: It is a game played between two or more players. Here, the computer plays the role of the other player where it chooses a random word from the 'sowpods.txt' file and we as a player have to guess it within the limited amount of chances (i.e, 6). The computer draws lines for each letter in an unknown word. We then have to guess the letters one by one in order to solve said word, with each correct letter being filled in as they go. Unlimited guesses are not allowed: for every wrong letter guessed, a body part is drawn hanging from a gallows. The point is to solve the mystery word before the complete hanging person is drawn. The 'sowpods.txt' has been included along with this file which has to be downloaded before running this python file. Also, the path of the 'sowpods.txt' file should be changed accordingly in the python file.
